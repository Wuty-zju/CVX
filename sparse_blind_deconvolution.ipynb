    "**15.15 Sparse blind deconvolution.** We are given a time series observation \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}^T \\), and seek a filter (convolution kernel) \\( w \\in \\mathbb{R}^k \\), so that the convolution \\( x = w * y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T + k - 1)} \\) is sparse after truncating the first and last \\( k - 1 \\) entries, i.e., \\( x_{k:T} = (x_k, x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_T) \\) is sparse. Here \\( * \\) denotes convolution,\n",
